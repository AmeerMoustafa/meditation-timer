# meditation-timer

Incredibly simple CLI meditation timer written in nodeJS. Looking for suggestions to make it bigger and better.

## :package: Installation: ##


Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/ForbiddenShadow/meditation-timer.git`

cd to the installation folder

`cd meditation-timer`

run npm to install dependancies

`npm install`

## :dart: Usage: ##

Meditate takes in one parameter of `-t` or `--time` to set how long you want to meditate for. Feel free to use `-h` for more information.

## :memo: To-do:

- Add hour/second support within time display
- Implement some sort of notification when the time runs out
- Used blessed to create a more complete terminal UI?
